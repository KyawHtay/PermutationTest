# PermutationTest
# Quick Coding Test

Welcome to  Quick Coding Test! This is a short coding problem that will hopefully take ~1hr.

Create a basic web app or write a function that accepts a string and returns true if any permutation of the string is the same read from the beginning or the end.

e.g. Input: "Pot spot" Output: True 

(because potential permutations could be: "topspot" or "potstop" etc.)

Notes:

- Consider code complexity

- Consider cases where we want to process long strings (e.g. a sentence)

- Use tests (TDD/BDD)

- Pay attention to code quality

- For Frontend developers UI not a requirement but appreciated :) 

- Feel free to make assumptions!

You can use any language you like! (in case you're wondering we use C# (backend) and JS + Vue (frontend) but you really don't have to)


( Assumption : Check only one string to match in permutation)
